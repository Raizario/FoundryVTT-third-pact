# Illandril's Pact Slot Third Caster (5e)

This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, for the DnD5e System, that adds a "Third Caster (Pact)" option for class spell progression.

Having levels in a Third Caster (Pact) classes will provide a character with Pact Slots and increase their Pact Slot Level as if they had 1/3 as many Warlock class levels. There are three options for rounding...
1. Standard Rounding (round down when multiclassing with other Pact Magic classes, round up otherwise; similar to non-Pact Third Casters)
1. Always Round Up
1. Always Round Down (ex. [Blood Hunter Order of the Profane Soul](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter#OrderoftheProfaneSoul))
